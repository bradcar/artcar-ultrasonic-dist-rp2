 Raspberry Pi Pico 2 ultrasonic distance - three sensors, can be front/back-facing temp/humidity correction 
 
This version of arduino ultrasonic distance has three sensors, can be front/back-facing temp/humidity correction

It was refactored from my Arduino code: https://github.com/bradcar/artcar-ultrasonic-dist-arduino

My work is based on this GREAT work: https://github.com/upiir/arduino_parking_sensor
