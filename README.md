This version of arduino ultrasonic distance has three sensors, can be front/back-facing temp/humidity correction
* It was refactored from my Arduino code: https://github.com/bradcar/artcar-ultrasonic-dist-arduino

My work is based on UPIR's GREAT work: https://github.com/upiir/arduino_parking_sensor created by upir, 2022, modified by bradcarlile 2024
